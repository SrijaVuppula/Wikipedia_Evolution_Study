# Wikipedia Evolution Study

## Abstract

This project develops and evaluates a system to perform a quantitative analysis of the evolution of Wikipedia articles over time. The technique used is based on W-Shingling, where documents are represented as sets of word sequences (shingles) of a given size, $w$. Each shingle is hashed using the hashing algorithm (MD5 in this project) to create a unique fingerprint. To approximate document similarity efficiently, a MinHash signature of size $\lambda$ is generated by selecting the smallest hash values. The Jaccard similarity value is then used to compare the present version of an article to its past versions. Experiments are conducted on a corpus of Wikipedia pages for various U.S. cities, testing shingle sizes of $w \in \{25, 50\}$ and signature sizes of $\lambda \in \{8, 16, 32, 64\}$.

The project successfully shows the decay in content similarity over revision history, identifies the optimal $\lambda$ value that best approximates the true similarity ($\lambda = \infty$), and analyzes the performance of the shingling process.

The results provide us with a structured process to measure how Wikipedia pages change over time. They also clearly demonstrate the practical compromise required when balancing computational **speed** against the **accuracy** of similarity scores, which is dictated by the **signature size**.
